# fight_picks
A Meteor JS app for letting you and your friends pick who will win fights from MMA events that you enter into it

Meteor has since made breaking changes, but the idea was an app for someone and their friends to save their picks for who they thought would win upcoming MMA fights and ooptionally how. It would then give out scores based on how accurate your predictions were. When I last was working on it, I was trying to implement a way to automatically update the results based on different MMA promotion websites. Alternatively I had it to where you could just submit the results to the database and then it would update user scores.
